Splash / startup experience

Bottom navigation with core sections: Home, Launch, Outside, Connect, Memories, and Profile

A Home screen featuring:

A search bar for places, vibes, and stories

Mock “friends outside” story previews

A map-style section with pinned locations and simulated crowd capacity (e.g. Long Street, Cape Town)

Clean project structure following Flutter best practices
